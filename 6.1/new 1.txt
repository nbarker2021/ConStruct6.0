	Explanation of Changes and Key Functions:

construct_superpermutation(n, config):

This is now the main entry point. It handles the iterative n-building process.
It takes a configuration dictionary (config) as input, which allows for easy customization of parameters and strategies.
It starts from n=1 and builds up to the target n.
For n <= 5, it uses the direct generation (generate_n_minus_1_superpermutation).
For n >= 6, it enters the main construction loop, which includes:
Strategy selection (dynamic, based on laminate analysis).
Hypothetical superpermutation generation (generate_hypothetical_superpermutation).
Bouncing Batch testing (simplified, without multiprocessing for now – this can be added back later).
Data update and analysis.
Periodical reconfiguration.
Termination condition (valid superpermutation found or maximum iterations reached).
It saves the best superpermutation found for each n.
It prepares data for next n.
generate_hypothetical_superpermutation(...):

This function now acts primarily as a dispatcher to different generation strategies.
The "n_minus_1_shell" strategy is the primary strategy. It calls:
select_n_minus_1_segments(...): To select appropriate segments from n-1 superpermutations.
insert_n_plus_1(...): To insert the nth symbol into the segments.
connect_segments(...): To connect the extended segments using bridge sequences.
The other strategies ("prodigal_combination", "de_bruijn", "mutation") are still present, but are used with lower probability (or as supporting strategies within the "n_minus_1_shell" approach).
Helper Functions (within construct.py):

select_n_minus_1_segments(...): Implemented. Selects n-1 segments based on prodigal status, extensibility, and other criteria.
connect_segments(...): Implemented (placeholder - simple concatenation for now). This is where the bridge generation logic will be crucial.
generate_candidates(...) and calculate_score(...) are retained and used by the various generation strategies.
